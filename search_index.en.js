My current \"rough\" answer to this question is that you should try to know something at the level at which you can begin to compose it with other ideas. Composing ideas is how we build things. So if you know it at this level, you can at least begin to build with your new knowledge.\nOne of the challenges of learning statics in undergrad is that it usually isn't taught at the depth at which you can begain to compose ideas together. The result is that many people carry around a bunch of seperate and distinct ideas in their head rather than a coehsive framework.\nThe starting point for learning statistics is to understand why you should care about the definition of a random variable. I admit, during my first years of graduate school I could recite the definition of a random variable, but I couldn't tell you why that definition was important.[^1] We didn't use in explicitly in any of the problem sets.\nLet me write out the definition and then I'll try to illustrate why it's important to care about this defintion.\n\n    Definition - A random variable is a function that maps from the sample space to the codomain. It is neither random (whatever that means) nor is it a variable. It's simply a function. The one constraint is that the pre-image of any open set in the codomain must be an element of the $\\sigma$-algebra associated with the sample space. We refer to this constraint as \"measurable.\"\n\nThe immediate question is -- why the constraint? Why do we care that the pre-image of any open sets in the codomain are elements of the initial $\\sigma$-algebra? Well, recall what a random variable is doing. It maps elements of the sample space to elements of the codomain. We'd like to be able to assign probabilities to open sets in our codomain. To do so, for each set we can look at the probability associated with the pre-image of that set. With a measurable function, this is well-defined.\nOkay, so that's the definition of a random variable and it assumes some understanding of the basics of probability spaces namely that probability measures are defined over $\\sigma$-algebras and that a $\\sigma$-algebra is a collection of subsets of the sample space[^2]  But stepping back, we see that the esseence of a random variable is that it maps a probability measure defined over one space to a probability measure defined over a space that we care about.\n$$\\Big( \\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P}\\Big) \\overset{X}{\\longmapsto} \\Big( \\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{R}), \\mathbb{P} \\circ X ^{-1}\\Big)  $$\n[^1] Admittedly, I didn't understand the definition.\n[^2] A $\\sigma$-algebra contains the empty set, and the sample space. It is closed under arbitrary unions and contains the complement of any set in the $\\sigma$-algebra.\n","id":"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/blog/random-variables/","title":"Random Variables"},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/blog/topology/":{"body":"\n","id":"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/blog/topology/","title":"Topology"},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/research/":{"body":"\nPublished Works\n \n How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic \n \n\nWe attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August 2010 reformulation of an oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many consumers to substitute an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August 2010, heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in areas with greater prereformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality: each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.\nWilliam N. Evans, Ethan M. J.

The Right to Counsel ensures that low-income tenants facing eviction have access to free legal representation. We exploit the recent adoption of this policy in some, but not all, zip codes in Connecticut. We show that legal representation improves court housing outcomes for those currently housed but adversely effects those currently unhoused. We use linear regression analysis for the intent-to-treat and IV estimates. We confirm our results using fine-tuned large language models and cluster regularized neural networks. We also provide insight about the type of tenants most likely to respond to the policy and how lawyers' strategies affect their clients housing outcomes.\n    \n  \n\n\n   Instrumental LLMs  \n  \n  In many applied microeconomic contexts, the underlying data is text (Health, Education, Housing). Causal inference in this setting has typically proceeded by hand selecting numerical representations of the text and estimating the corresponding conditional expectation function assuming that treatment or the instrument is locally randomly assigned.  Recent developments in Natural Language Processing/AI though have an introduced alternative ways to produce causal estimates from text. In this paper we (1) clarify the general framework for using fine-tuned large language models for causal inference and (2) highlight their relative strengths in the setting of IV with preferential treatment.\n\n\n\n   Regularizing the Forward Pass  \n  \nIn certain applied microeconomic settings, it's typical to view one's dataset as the realization of a stratified cluster randomized control trial: treatment is assigned at the cluster level (such as zip code), and controls vary at both the individual and cluster level. Locally, this makes it more likely that observation will be from the same cluster which can increase the variance for estimators which don't account for the clustered nature of the data. We introduce a framework for partialling out nonparametric cluster effects in a way that generalizes least squares and is inherently compositional even under regularization.

His approach, and the one that I try to embody, is to support students, to challenge them, and then to continue to support them in that order.\nI have found this approach particularly effective when it comes to Economics because while many aspects of the subject are intuitive, there are components that really stretch students. Most students making the jump from Principles of Microeconomics to Intermediate Microeconomics find it difficult to solve for the equilibrium of a model or to use implicit differentiation to find the slope of an indifference curve.\nOf course, never has it been easier for a student making this jump to produce correct results without understanding the underlying material. And indeed, the emergence of technology such as chatGPT forces us to reflect on what is it that we actually want to teach – what is it that we want students to experience during the course and be able to reflect on and use after the course.\nMy own thinking is that more and more undergraduate work will be project based where the aim is to leverage current and developing technologies in new and exciting ways. Lectures will become more conceptual in nature with less emphasis placed on pen and paper manipulations of equations. And class conversations will become more real world oriented, diving into details of markets that we can capture by writing our models in python code with chatGPT’s assistance.\nUltimately, however the education of Economics develops, students will always be presented with challenging tasks that push them out of their comfort zone. My experience has been that in order for students to invest the time and energy required to extend themselves, they need to know that you have their best interest in mind. That while you’re asking them to do their best, you’re also doing everything you can to help them be successful.\nLike most graduate students, I’ve certainly made my fair share of mistakes as a teacher both in terms of the material I chose to present and the way that I presented it. I’ve been fortunate to have been given the opportunity though to teach two semesters at Boston University and this fall at Harvard University. As with anything, though, with experience and reflection you become better. Currently, I would be comfortable teaching a range of courses from Principles of Microeconomics to the Applications of Machine Learning in Economics.\n","id":"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/teaching/","title":"Teaching"}},"docInfo":{"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/":{"body":2,"title":0},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/about/":{"body":6,"title":0},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/blog/random-variables/":{"body":245,"title":2},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/blog/topology/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/research/":{"body":307,"title":1},"https://pharringtonp19.github.io/teaching/":{"body":246,"title":1}},"length":7},"lang":"English"}
