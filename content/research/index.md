## Works in Progress 

**Regularizing the Forward Pass (JMP)**\
In line with the thinking that "nonparametric identitifcation + parameteric estimation -> causal flavor" (as mostly prominently advocated for in Mostly Harmless Econometrics), we introduce an approach to causal inference that generalizes OLS, flexible accounts for clustering effects and is inherently compositional. Based upon recent developments in deep learning (i.e Neural ODEs and MAML), our model provides an attractive alternative to the classical approach (i.e linear model + cluster standard errors).
