Applied microeconomics analysis involves making tradeoffs -- determining which issues are first order and which can be potentially addressed in an appendix (or not at all!). Based on the deep learning literature of meta-learning and neural ordinary differential equations, and in the language of category theory, we introduce a unified structure that allows one to think through these tradeoffs: the structure generalizes ordinary least squares, allows for nonparametric cluster effects, and is inherently compositional even under regularization. We apply this framework to assess the effectiveness of an initiative,  growing in popularity across the U.S., known as the Right to Counsel (RTC). Aiming to combat the 3.6 million eviction fillings that occur each year in the U.S., the Right to Counsel ensures access to free legal representation for low-income individuals facing eviction. Complimenting the small, but growing Economic literature on the topic, we consider the indirect effects of this policy. Specifically, we consider whether the policy makes it harder for those currently unhoused to find housing. As some have suggested, if the Right to Counsel increases the cost of evicting a tenant, landlords might respond by making it harder for low-income individuals to rent a unit in the first place. Using data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and exploiting the staggered roll-out across the state of Connecticut, our initial results point towards an increase in the length of the housing search in response to the policy. This effect points higher for African American women in particular. We caution, though, that our results are extremely preliminary as the implementation of the policy is ongoing.

Applied microeconomic analysis involves making tradeoffs -- assessing which issues are first order, and which can potentially be addressed in an appendix or not at all. Based the recent deep learning literature on gradient based meta-learning and regularized neural ordinary differential equations, and in the language of category theory, we introduce a unified structure that allows one to think through these tradeoffs (as our structure generalizes OLS, allows for nonparametric cluster effects, and is inherently compositional even under regularization). We apply this framework to a variety of applied microeconomic contexts estimating average, local, and heterogeneous treatment effects.

**[How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/101/1/1/58660/How-the-Reformulation-of-OxyContin-Ignited-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)**\

We attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August 2010 reformulation of an oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many consumers to substitute an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August 2010, heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in areas with greater prereformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality: each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.
