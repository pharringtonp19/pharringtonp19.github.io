## Works in Progress 

**Regularizing the Forward Pass (JMP)**\
In line with the thinking that "nonparametric identitifcation + parameteric estimation -> causal flavor" (as mostly prominently advocated in Mostly Harmless Econometrics), we introduce a causal framework that generalizes OLS, flexible accounts for clustering effects and is inherently compositional. Based upon recent developments in deep learning (i.e Neural ODEs and MAML), our model generally outperforms the classical approach (i.e linear model + cluster standard errors approach) 
across a broad set of data generating processes.
