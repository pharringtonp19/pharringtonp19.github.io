Drawing from the Deep Learning Literature and in the language of Category Theory, we introduce a unified estimation framework that generalizes ordinary least squares, allows for nonparametric cluster effects, and is inherently compositional, even under regularization. With this framework, we examine the effects of the Right to Counsel: a policy which ensures that low-income households facing eviction have access to free legal representation. Specifically, we consider the extent to which the policy increases housing instability by making it harder for low-income households to secure housing in the first place. Exploiting the ongoing roll-out of the policy across the state of Connecticut, our preliminary results suggest that housing is harder to secure in areas with higher eviction rates, which suggests  that the policy is less effective at scale than previously understood.

<!-- **[Regularizing the Forward Pass](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/rfp_paper/blob/main/Regularizing_the_Forward_Pass.pdf)** (with Shomik Ghosh and Markus Schwedeler)

Applied microeconomic analysis involves making tradeoffs -- assessing which issues are first order, and which can potentially be addressed in an appendix or not at all. Based the recent deep learning literature on gradient based meta-learning and regularized neural ordinary differential equations, and in the language of category theory, we introduce a unified structure that allows one to think through these tradeoffs (as our structure generalizes OLS, allows for nonparametric cluster effects, and is inherently compositional even under regularization). We apply this framework to a variety of applied microeconomic contexts estimating average, local, and heterogeneous treatment effects.

**[How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/101/1/1/58660/How-the-Reformulation-of-OxyContin-Ignited-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)**\

We attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August 2010 reformulation of an oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many consumers to substitute an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August 2010, heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in areas with greater prereformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality: each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.
