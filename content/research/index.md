## Works in Progress  

**[Regularizing the Forward Pass (RFP)](https://www.overleaf.com/project/62925289505fc3e8f64a0674)**\
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
In line with the thinking that "nonparametric identitifcation + parameteric estimation -> causal flavor" (as mostly prominently advocated for in Mostly Harmless Econometrics), we build upon our work in (<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/project/62d813cdbcfea4e31284e1de">GAC</a>) by introducing a model that that generalizes OLS, flexible accounts for clustering effects and is inherently compositional. Based upon recent developments in deep learning (i.e Neural ODEs and MAML), our model provides an attractive alternative to the classical approach (i.e linear model + cluster standard errors).

**[Generalizing Across Clusters](https://www.overleaf.com/project/62d813cdbcfea4e31284e1de)**\
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
Observational data is messy. To account for this, econometric methods should be well targeted (i.e. address a specific issue) and composable (i.e. the components fit togther). Building upon prominent work in the meta-learning community, we introduce a relatively simple, model agnostic approach which accounts for the clustered nature of one's data. Specifically, we introduce a gradient correction that favors early stopping at the cluster level.

**[How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/101/1/1/58660/How-the-Reformulation-of-OxyContin-Ignited-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)**\
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
We attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August 2010 reformulation of an oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many consumers to substitute an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August 2010, heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in areas with greater prereformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality: each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.
