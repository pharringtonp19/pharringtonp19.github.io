Both the importance and fragility of housing for low-income individuals has been magnified by the recent events of Covid-19 and increasing inflation. In response to this, we focus in this paper on assessing the effectiveness of the Right to Counsel initiative to promote housing stability. Aiming to combat the 3.6 million eviction fillings each year in the US, the policy provides free legal representation for low income individuals and families. In this paper, we exploit the staggered implementation of the policy across the state of Connecticut. Specifically, we consider the extent to which such a policy may actually increase housing instability, as some have speculated, by making it harder for those currently unhoused to find permanent housing. Using data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, we find little evidence to suggest that such a policy has adverse effects at scale. We note, that our results are preliminary.

**[Regularizing the Forward Pass](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/rfp_paper/blob/main/Regularizing_the_Forward_Pass.pdf)** (with Shomik Ghosh and Markus Schwedeler)
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
Applied microeconomic analysis involves making tradeoffs -- assessing which issues are first order, and which can potentially be addressed in an appendix or not at all. Based the recent deep learning literature on gradient based meta-learning and regularized neural ordinary differential equations, and in the language of category theory, we introduce a unified structure that allows one to think through these tradeoffs (as our structure generalizes OLS, allows for nonparametric cluster effects, and is inherently compositional even under regularization). We apply this framework to a variety of applied microeconomic contexts estimating average, local, and heterogeneous treatment effects.

**[How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/101/1/1/58660/How-the-Reformulation-of-OxyContin-Ignited-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext)**\
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
We attribute the recent quadrupling of heroin death rates to the August 2010 reformulation of an oft-abused prescription opioid, OxyContin. The new abuse-deterrent formulation led many consumers to substitute an inexpensive alternative, heroin. Using structural break techniques and variation in substitution risk, we find that opioid consumption stops rising in August 2010, heroin deaths begin climbing the following month, and growth in heroin deaths was greater in areas with greater prereformulation access to heroin and opioids. The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality: each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death.
