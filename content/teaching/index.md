I teach an intermediate-level microeconomics course at Boston University. The class website can be found [here](https://pharringtonp19.github.io/mecon/).
While we follow [Hal Varian's Intermediate Mircoeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393689983), we depart from it in two ways. 

### Probability Theory 

Intermediate Economics is concerned with modeling decision making. In many contexts, decisions are made with some level of uncertainty. In this course, to model uncertainty we make use of probability theory and in particular we emphasize the structure of a probability space and random variables. 

$$\big( \Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P} \big) \quad X: \Omega \to \mathcal{R}$$



### Math on the Computer

A lot of time is wasted in Economic courses explaining how to solve optimization problems. In this class, we focus on how to build economic models, not how to solve them. For example, we discuss and work through how we want to model consumer heterogeneity (by allowing the parameters of the utility and constraint functions to differ across individuals). We don't worry about how to solve these models. This allows us to focus more on the economics of the model and less on the engineering. We're do so by writing our models in python and calling solvers on these models. An example slide that highlights this process is shown below.
