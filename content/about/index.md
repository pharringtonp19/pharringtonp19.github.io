  I am a PhD student of Economics at Boston University. My research focuses on issues related to low-income households, specifically opioid use and housing. In this context, I am interested in applying deep-learning/AI techniques to better assess the effects of policies like the "Right to Counsel" in eviction cases (Job Market Paper).

  I've taught two semesters of Intermediate Microeconomics at Boston University (Fall 2021 & 2022) and am currently teaching an a seminar on the Economics of Housing and Homelessness at Harvard University. 

  I am advised by Ivan Fernandez-Val, Hiroaki Kaido and Kevin Lang of Boston University. 


   <!-- My research interests were initially shaped by my undergraduate experience at the University of Notre Dame. Working with Bill Evans and Ethan Lieber, I became interested in studying the effectiveness of policies that shape/influence the lives of low income individuals. In graduate school, as a part of Winnie Van Dijk’s reading groups at Harvard on Housing and Homeless, these interests were only further solidified. To date, I’ve worked on papers related to the opioid epidemic as well as the role of legal aid in evictions. And this fall, I am teaching an undergraduate seminar course at Harvard on the Economics of Housing and Homelessness.

  My belief is that the aim of applied work should be to provide greater insight about some context or policy. As I emphasize in my undergraduate course, this often requires spending time on the ground gaining experience about how things function. In my own personal work, this has involved spending time in housing court, shadowing a State Marshall, and volunteering at a harm reduction center. Learning from individuals who operate in these environments day-to-day makes one’s research more policy relevant, more credible, and ultimately more informative. 

  At the same time, though, greater insight comes from leveraging recents developments in statistics and AI. When I have taught undergraduate microeconomics, I encorporated python and automatic differentiation into the course so that students could build models which capture heterogeneity across consumers. In my own papers, I have done so by fine-tuning large language models directly on eviction case records to estimate the IV parameters, as well as trained neural networks via bi-level gradient descent to assess treatment effect heterogeneity. 

  As any economist can attest, the nature of economic work has evolved rapidly over the past few years – from the explosion of papers developing novel difference-in-difference techniques to the use of chatGPT as a coding expert Research Assistant. I believe that the best work and the best teaching incorporates these constantly evolving techniques. We want to provide greater insight in our research and best prepare students for an ever increasing AI workplace. As Richard Sutton's ''The Bitter Lesson'' would suggest, we do so by steping along the direction of greater compute! -->
