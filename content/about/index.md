 I am an applied microeconomist working on topics related to housing and opioids. 
 
 <!--In addition to my applied work, I wopotential outcome centeric approach to causal inference might be stengthen by the application of deep learning models. My job market paper is a reflection of these two interests.





### In the spirit of Collin Cowherd's weekly segment ...

#### Where I was wrong (in Graduate School)
- I didn't think I would really need to learn how to program 
- I thought topics like measure theory were "too" difficult to learn 
- I thought I needed to understand the theory of deep learning before I could start using it in practice 
- I thought multiple hypothesis testing was first order 

#### Where I was right (in Graduate School) 
- I bet on a lot of smart/excellent people (most of whom I've never met). To name a few
    - Josh Angrist, Larry Wasserman, Hiro Kaido, The Jax Team, Patrick Kidger
- It's all about interpretation
    - Applied econometrics is all about interpretation. Someone fits a statistical model in a given context. How should we interpret the results? -->
