### Overview
I am an currently working on topics related to housing and opioids.

<!-- ### Where I was wrong in Graduate School 
- I didn't think I would really need to learn how to program 
- I thought topics like measure theory were "too" difficult to learn 
- I thought I needed to understand the theory of deep learning before I could start using it in practice 
- I thought multiple hypothesis testing was first order 

### Where I was right in Graduate School 
- I bet on a lot of smart/excellent people. To name a few
    - Josh Angrist, Larry Wasserman, Hiro Kaido, The Jax Team, Patrick Kidger
- It's all about interpretation
    - Applied econometrics is all about interpretation. Someone fits a statistical model in a given context. How should we interpret the results? -->
