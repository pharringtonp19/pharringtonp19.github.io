  I am a Data Scientist at Yale's School of Public Health and a Teaching Fellow in the Economics Department at Harvard University.  I am also a board memeber on Rhode Island's Coalition to End Homelessness.
  
  My research and teaching focuses on the Economics of housing and homelessness. I teach an undergraduate seminar course on the topic. And my research applies deep-learning techniques to better assess the effects of policies like the "Right to Counsel" in eviction cases ([Job Market Paper](https://github.com/pharringtonp19/papers/blob/main/The_Right_to_Counsel_at_Scale_latest.pdf)). 

  I am also interested in programming, causal inference, and probability, and have taught an [introductory analytics](https://pharringtonp19.github.io/business-analytics/) class on these concepts.

   <!-- My research interests were initially shaped by my undergraduate experience at the University of Notre Dame. Working with Bill Evans and Ethan Lieber, I became interested in studying the effectiveness of policies that shape/influence the lives of low income individuals. In graduate school, as a part of Winnie Van Dijk’s reading groups at Harvard on Housing and Homeless, these interests were only further solidified. To date, I’ve worked on papers related to the opioid epidemic as well as the role of legal aid in evictions. And this fall, I am teaching an undergraduate seminar course at Harvard on the Economics of Housing and Homelessness.

  My belief is that the aim of applied work should be to provide greater insight about some context or policy. As I emphasize in my undergraduate course, this often requires spending time on the ground gaining experience about how things function. In my own personal work, this has involved spending time in housing court, shadowing a State Marshall, and volunteering at a harm reduction center. Learning from individuals who operate in these environments day-to-day makes one’s research more policy relevant, more credible, and ultimately more informative. 

  At the same time, though, greater insight comes from leveraging recents developments in statistics and AI. When I have taught undergraduate microeconomics, I encorporated python and automatic differentiation into the course so that students could build models which capture heterogeneity across consumers. In my own papers, I have done so by fine-tuning large language models directly on eviction case records to estimate the IV parameters, as well as trained neural networks via bi-level gradient descent to assess treatment effect heterogeneity. 

  As any economist can attest, the nature of economic work has evolved rapidly over the past few years – from the explosion of papers developing novel difference-in-difference techniques to the use of chatGPT as a coding expert Research Assistant. I believe that the best work and the best teaching incorporates these constantly evolving techniques. We want to provide greater insight in our research and best prepare students for an ever increasing AI workplace. As Richard Sutton's ''The Bitter Lesson'' would suggest, we do so by steping along the direction of greater compute! -->
