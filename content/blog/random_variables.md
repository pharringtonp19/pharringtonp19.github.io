For any topic we're learning, a fundamental question is "at what level do I need to know this topic"? For example, if we're interested in learning how to train a neural network in python, at what level do we need to know how to do this? Should we write the program in numpy and compute the derivatives by hand? Should we use something like keras with predefied layers and models? 

Of course, there's no correct answer to this question, but as a rule of thumb I strive to learn a topic at the level of detail so that I am able to compose it with other ideas.
